            <p>This site&#39;s focus is <b>lightning network</b>, <b>BOLTs</b>, and <b>operating a lightning node</b>. We welcome posts that are:
            <ul>
                <li>detailed and specific, written clearly and simply</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>No question is too trivial or too &quot;newbie&quot;.</p>
            <p>But we recommend that you see if your question has already been asked (perhaps
                even answered!) before you ask. But if you end up asking a question that has been asked before, that is fine too.
                Other users will hopefully edit in links to related or similar questions to help future visitors find their way.</p>
